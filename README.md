# Binary Whitespace Encoder and Decoder
This project uses zero-width whitespaces and binary encoding to hide String values, the process consists of converting the String to a binary value and then mapping the 0's and 1's into specified zero-width whitespaces, which results in a zero-width string which contains all the information.

This project is merely a proof of concept to some friends.
